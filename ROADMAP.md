# ROADMAP

- Clean up the README to reflect the fact that this will be designed to be built as a simple binary, leaving it up to the user where to deploy it.

- Architect this to work with the deployment method of choice (Google Cloud Run?)

- Write a Terraform module that end-users can use to self-host this

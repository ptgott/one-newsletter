# ROADMAP

## Required for deployment

1. Prevent unbounded email additions. (a) Add a configurable limit of links per site. Choose which links to include in an email randomly. (b) Add a maximum number of links per email.

1. Handle more complex client situations when polling e-publications, such as retries and non-2xx responses. (Currently this has no defensive measures at all--we just call `http.Client.Get` in `main.go`) Research common pitfalls with web scraping.

1. Come up with a release process. Change the module name to `www.github.com/ptgott/divnews`, including in all imports. Currently it's set to `divnews`.

## Can be done after deployment

1. Add a makefile with “test-unit” and “test-e2e” targets

1. Add inline `<style>` tags to the email HTML to achieve styling.

1. Add more documentation:

   - Update the README to describe the architecture of the application (what each package does and how they work together).
   - Make sure there's an adequate `doc.go` for every package.

1. Consider using the lowest common ancestor approach shown [here](https://www.benawad.com/scraping-recipe-websites) to find lists of links automatically without requiring the user to specify this via a CSS selector.

1. Consider vendoring dependencies. Also consider running MailHog as a library (and vendoring it) so we don't have a dependency that risks becoming unavailable.

1. Add a unit test for `(db *BadgerDB) Cleanup()` so we don't need to rely on the e2e test.
